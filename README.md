#  Online Library Project

A powerful and modern digital library interface.

This project is more than just a user interface â€” itâ€™s a fully functional JavaScript application crafted with **modular architecture (IIFE pattern)**, **semantic HTML**, and **scalable BEM-based CSS**. It allows users to manage a virtual library with interactive book management features, state tracking, and live search â€” all without any frontend frameworks.

## Project Description

A modern and interactive digital library built entirely with **vanilla JavaScript**, **semantic HTML**, and **CSS Grid**.  
This project stands out with its **modular architecture** and strong separation of concerns, offering a clean and maintainable codebase while delivering rich user interactions.

Despite being built without any libraries or frameworks, the project handles **state management**, **DOM rendering**, and **user input processing** through handcrafted, modular logic â€” a challenging feat accomplished through thoughtful design.

## Main Highlights

- **Fully Modular JavaScript Architecture**: Robust structure using the **Module Pattern** with IIFE, ensuring clear encapsulation and reusability.

- **Dynamic Book Management System**: Add, remove, toggle read status, and live-search books â€” all dynamically handled and rendered via DOM manipulation.

- **Prototype-Based OOP Logic**: Book objects are created with a custom prototype structure for shared behavior (`getInfo`, `toggleStatus`), demonstrating deeper JavaScript understanding.

- **BEM + CSS Grid Styling**: Clean and maintainable CSS with **Block Element Modifier (BEM)** naming and **CSS Grid** for responsive layouts.

- **Accessible UI Elements**: Buttons with `aria-labels`, hidden text spans, and semantic structure improve accessibility and usability.
